# Arduino fusebit doctor sheld for Atmega 8/48/88/168/328

This expansion board for Arduino Uno is a fusebit eraser for Atmega 8/48/88/168/328 microcontrollers in case of improper settings and MC blocking.
For the device to work, you need to supply 12 volts to the Arduino Uno using a standard external power connector.
It is also necessary to set a jumper in accordance with the MC selected for unlocking. The s8050 transistor can be replaced with any npn transistor that is at hand.
